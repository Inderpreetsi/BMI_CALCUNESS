This is my first app on the flutter platform in dart programming language(obviously). 
The most common app for tracking fitness goals. it simply takes personal data from an user and then by using simple mathematics it provides the result of that user.
Result determines the category of the person like underweight, normal or overweight by calculating their body mass index.
It's front end is very attractive because of flutter themes and designs.
